// gopackagesdriver provides the interface between go/packages (and consumers of

// IDE-style support. It, like other bazel tooling, expects to be run in the
// top-level directory of a bazel project.
//
// The path to its binary is meant to be set to the
// $GOPACKAGESDRIVER environment variable or installed as gopackagesdriver in a
// user's path so that go/packages can use it.
